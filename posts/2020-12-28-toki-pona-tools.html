      <p><a href="//tokipona.org">toki pona</a><span class="linksize">(199kB)</span> is a minimalist conlang (constructed language).</p>

      <p>In the process of learning toki pona, I realised that a few digital tools could make it a lot easier, so over the past year I've developed a site to host these tools.
      
      <p>First off, I needed a handy, useful, versatile, and quick dictionary.. something I could just type a word in and get all the definitions and its glyph in <a href="http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/hieroglyphs.php">sitelen pona</a><span class="linksize">(241kB)</span> instantly. I also wanted to be able to search up words by starting to type them or reverse searching by definition.<br>& also I thought it would be useful to be able to just highlight text from whatever I'm reading and get those definitions.</p>
      <p>So I coded that <a href="../lipu-ilo-lili/ilo">interactive dictionary</a><span class="linksize">(72kB)</span>
      <img src=../images/tp_highlight.png alt="highlighted toki pona text with definitions displayed beneath"><img src=../images/tp_lookup.png alt="'sit' entered into searchbox and toki pona words containing 'sit' in name or definition displayed below">
      <aside>(the actual definitions are taken from various sources (not me), see page for credits)</aside>

      <p>Then, I saw there were a few systems people had made of writing in toki pona (including those afformentioned glyphs) but no central way of converting between them all, so I made an <a href="../lipu-ilo-lili/encodings">"encoding converter"</a><span class="linksize">(74kB)</span>, with a translate-esque box, dynamic tables, and simple settings menu</p>
      <img src=../images/tp_allencodes.png alt='usage of interactive encoder tool, converting plaintext to all encodings'><img src=../images/tp_translate.png alt='usage of interactive encoder tool, converting emoji into symbols'><img src=../images/tp_table.png alt='snippet of table of toki pona encodings'>
      <aside>(note that, save for <a href="../lipu-ilo-lili/sitelen Uniko">one particular unicode mapping</a><span class="linksize">(413kB)</span>, none of these 'encodings' were made by me, see dedicated page for credits)</aside>

      <p>Then I collated them together into a small site and gave it a sleek, consistent aesthetic. go check out the <a href="../lipu-ilo-lili/">lipu sinpin (home page)</a><span class="linksize">(55kB)</span> ^-^
